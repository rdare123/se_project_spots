# Project 3: Spots

### Overview

- Intro
- Figma
- Images

**Intro**

With this project, I used multiple grid layouts to make a website compatible for various screen sizes. The profile secton changes from a row layout to a column layout on smaller devices using media queries. Images, the main portion of the webpage, is controlled by a grid with 3 columns. Using media queries, these columns shrink depeding on the screen size until there is only oe column left. I opted for the media query route over auto-fit as it kept the cards centered more easily.

The website can be viewed [here.](https://rdare123.github.io/se_project_spots/)

**Figma**

Using Figma's tools, I was able to figure out the necessary spacing, text details, colors, etc., along with being able export SVGs and images required for the wesbite to function.
